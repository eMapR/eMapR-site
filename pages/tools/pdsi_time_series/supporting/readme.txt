https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/historical-palmers/	

If using this method for PDSI retrieval then use pdsi.xlxs as guide to format the data, save the third sheet as a csv file (see pdsi.csv)
Use this csv file as input into the pdsi_format_for_js.r script


-palmer drough severity index
-palmer hydrological drought index
-palmer modified drough index
-palmer z-index
