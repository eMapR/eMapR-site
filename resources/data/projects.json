We are collaborators in a project led by Dr. John Battles at UC Berkeley to combine innovations in remote sensing technology, advances in cloud computing, and detailed biometric data in an effort to build a methodology to monitor annual changes in carbon storage in Californiaâ€™s forest. Our role is to create biomass maps with the help of the OSU LEMMA group using data generated by running our LandTrendr algorithm on Google Earth Engine.",

		"descr": "Building a bridge between Landsat time-series data and carbon modelers. <a href='https://carbon.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)<\/a> is a program designed to characterize, quantify, understand, and predict the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. We have partnered with process-based modelers in this project to provide time series maps of land cover, biomass, tree cover, impervious surface cover as inputs to their models. Our task is to produce these data for the contiguous United States and build a convenient, modern, web-based data retrieval system, bridging the gap between data producers and data users.",
